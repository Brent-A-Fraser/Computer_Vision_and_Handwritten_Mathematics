Using CNNs recognize and solve handwritten matrix equations.

Digits, brackets, and operation images found at https://www.kaggle.com/michelheusser/handwritten-digits-and-operators and MNIST digits.

Matrix data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/brentfraser/handwritten-matrices-synthetic-image-data
This does not include the neural network predictions.

All code is present in order of workflow.

Code for synthesizing matrices and other relevent data found within the notebook is currently commented out.

Some misclassifications will cause errors. Rerunning equation generating cells to generate a new equation is required in this case.
